请在创建前先确认这确实是个 issue。
- 类似这些情况可创建 issue: 明确的bug，非预期的结果，安全风险等；
- 类似以下这些情况不是 issue: 咨询如何实现某一功能，讨论想法等，这些请移步到 Discussion 区创建讨论 https://github.com/hizzgdev/jsmind/discussions/new?category=general

We have changed the issue creation policy. Please make sure that it is indeed an issue before creating it.
- Issues can be created for situations like these: clear bugs, unexpected results, security risks, etc.
- Situations like these are not issues: questions about how to build a certain feature, share or discuss ideas, etc. For these, please go to Discussion tab to create a discussion there https://github.com/hizzgdev/jsmind/discussions/new?category=general
